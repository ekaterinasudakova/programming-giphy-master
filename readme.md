# Intro - Giphy
In this repo you'll find an empty html page with the javascript prewritten to get GIFs from GIPHY via ajax.

## Setup
In order to make it work, you'll need a Giphy API account, and to go through the process of getting an API KEY, which you'll put in the a JS file called secrets.js. See secrets.example.js for an example.

## Cool though?
Once you have the example working, fetching cat gifs and putting their data in the console, make it cooler. What gifs should it get? Where should it put them? Is this a tool? A game? A stress-ball? An art piece? Idk. Make cool shit.
